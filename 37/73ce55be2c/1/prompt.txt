ghq createと一緒にいい感じにできるようなコマンドにしたいな対話型でrepo nameを効くようにする、ただ、gitを初期化したくない時もあるからいい感じに設計して

いい感じだが、--localを明示しない限りgit initされるかたちでいい

---

nameも明示するようにして

---

コミットして

---

コミlッツ推して

---

いいんだけど、任意のテンプレートをfuzzyしたいのでもう少し抽象化したいな

---

[Request interrupted by user]

---

ただ、ashibaはashibaのまま、その中でさらに抽象化した関数を呼ぶようにしたい

---

うん、そんな感じで

---

ashiba,もっと薄くできる気が

---

nfiはfuzzyに集中したいな、やっぱり、nameは受け取らない前提

---

unix哲学に従って、ashibaがまだ太すぎる気がする

---

REAMDE更新してコミットして

---

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

---

ashibaは廃止して、nfiのただのエイリアスにしたい

---

なんで関数にしてるの？

---

ンsんで引数転送する必要がないの？

---

nrnはなぜ関数⁉︎

---

コミットして

---

https://github.com/the-nix-way/dev-templates これもよく使う

---

ndtにしよう

---

コミットして

---

土居やって使うんだって、nfi

---

gコマンドみたいにtemplates:って

pecoとfzfってどっちがいいんだっけ
